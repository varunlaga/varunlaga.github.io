For the Narrative Visualization Project in Data Visualization, I designed a website using Github Pages to convey the message about the data and the URL is below. In this project, I chose the dataset below to implement a martini glass structure and this structure is where the message is delivered without allowing user exploration until the end. Feel free to click on the website URL to learn more about my narrative visualization!
