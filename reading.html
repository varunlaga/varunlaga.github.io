    <p style="text-align: left;">
        The side by side bar chart below displays the students average reading scores based on their gender and parental education levels.
        Just like the side by side bar chart on the previous page, you can hover over the bars. 
    </p>

    <br>

    <p style="text-align: left;">
        Based on this side by side bar chart, you can notice that students average reading scores tend to be high for both genders when their parents have the highest level of education but there are some exceptions. 
        For example, male students have the highest average reading score of 71.61 when their parental level is bachelor's degree while female students 
        have the highest average reading score of 79.67 when their parental level is master's degree as highlighted by the annotations below. 
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">
        When you compare this chart with the previous chart, you can notice male students tend to have higher average math scores while female students tend to 
        have higher average reading scores when you hover over the bars.
