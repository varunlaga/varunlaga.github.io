    <p style="text-align: left;">
        The side by side bar chart below displays the students average math scores based on their gender and parental education levels.

        Based on this side by side bar chart, you can notice that students average math scores tend to be high for both genders when their parents have
        the highest level of education but there are some exceptions. For example, male students have the highest average math score
        of 75.94 when their parental level is bachelor's degree while female students have the highest average math score of 71.48 when
        their parental level is master's degree as highlighted by the annotations below.
